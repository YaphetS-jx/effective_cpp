/* memory order: 
   1. relaxed: no synchronization, no ordering constraints
   2. acquire: ensures that operations before the acquire are visible to other threads before the acquire
   3. release: ensures that operations after the release are visible to other threads after the release
   4. acquire-release: ensures that operations before the acquire are visible to other threads before the acquire, and operations after the release are visible to other threads after the release
   5. seq_cst: ensures that operations are executed in a single total order, and that this order is consistent with the program order
