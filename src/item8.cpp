/* exception propagation in destructor
1. if an exception is thrown in a destructor, the program will terminate if the exception is not caught, 
   the memory will not be freed properly. 
2. whenever an exception is thrown, it will stop executing the codes after 
   the exception is thrown in current scope. 
3. Always wrap the exception in a try-catch block in the destructor to prevent the program from terminating.
4. Below code works, but if there is another exception thrown in the destructor, the program will terminate.

/* Stack Unwinding
1. An exception is thrown: When an exception is thrown inside a function, normal execution stops.
2. Functions start to exit: The function that encountered the exception exits without completing.
3. Destructors are called: If any local objects were created in that function, their destructors 
   are automatically called before the function exits.
4. The stack unwinds to the caller: If the function doesnâ€™t catch the exception, the exception 
   propagates to the function that called it.
5. Repeats until a handler is found: The process continues up the call stack until a try-catch 
   block is found. If no catch block is found, the program terminates (std::terminate() is called).
